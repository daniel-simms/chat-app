# chat-app

This is a real time chat application using Node.js. It was a follow along tutorial from Udemy, credit to Andrew Mead. The Udemy course helped me become familiar with Node.js

The application is using the socket.io npm package for bi-directional communication. It is hosted on Heroku using CLI to push to the heroku servers.
